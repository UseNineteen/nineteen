I tried it on and of course I feel in love with it.  There was a bit of a wait at the register which kind of angered me, since they have many registers and only employee ringing up the items.  I did wait and tried to practice what I teach my own patients-\"breathe and let go.\"  \r\n\r\nTJ Maxx is great because I tend to like to buy designer items and if you get lucky you can find exactly what you had been looking for.

I spent a grand total for a leather bag and wallet of around 45.00.  That is crazy insane.  I am so excited.  I do not own a brown bag and this one is so very pretty.  I am so glad I deceided to shop in the store and not buy this item on line.  I received extra savings by going in the store.  I did look for clothes but did not really find anything that I really liked or wanted to spend the monty on.",
