# nineteen
Nineteen is a qualitative data visualization tool, created by Ted Pollari & Kim Erwin.
It takes excel spreadsheets / .csv files and turns them into interactive visualizations for researchers.

All data processing happens in the browser. Users' data never makes it back to the server - this means your research is *your research*. 
You can use it for confidential data without worrying about uploading your data to some random server (with one exception - described below)

If you want to save copies of the visualization as a static image or as a packaged HTML file that will open with a saved view of the data & 
allow full interaction with it, you can – but this will require a brief round-trip of your data so things can be packaged up. 
No data is ever saved or stored.
